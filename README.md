Personal project focused on making a functional desktop like prototype.

You can see the video of the project here: [video](https://youtu.be/827fYIgjJ-8).

You can play the prototype here: [itch.io](https://vizco.itch.io/desktop-ui).

The [FEEL](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/feel-183370) and [vInspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/vinspector-245000) assets are needed in order to have proper access to the entire project.
